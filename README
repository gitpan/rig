NAME
    rig - import groups of favorite/related modules with a single expression

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
    In your "/home/user/.perlrig" yaml file:

       favorite:
          use:
             - strict
             - warnings
             - List::Util:
                - first
                - max
             - Data::Dumper

    Back in your code:

       use rig favorite;

       # same as:
       #   use strict;
       #   use warnings;
       #   use List::Util qw/first max/;
       #   use Data::Dumper;

       # now have a ball:

       print first { $_ > 10 } @ary; # from List::Utils;
       print Dumper $foo;  # from Data::Dumper

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to organize and bundle your favorite modules,
    thus reducing the recurring task of "use"ing them in your programs, and
    implicitly requesting imports by default.

    You can rig your bundles in 2 places:

    *   A file called ".perlrig" in your home or current working directory.

    *   Packages undeneath the "rig::task::<rig_task_name">, for better
        portability.

IMPLEMENTATION
    This module uses lots of internal "goto"s to trick modules to think
    they're being loaded by the original caller, and not by "rig" itself. It
    also hooks into "import" to keep modules loading after a "goto".

    Modules that don't have an "import()" method are instead "eval"led into
    the caller's package.

    This is somewhat hacky, there are probably better ways of achieving the
    same results. We're open to suggestions on how to make loading modules
    more generic and effective. Just fork me on Github!

USAGE
  Code
        use rig -file   => '/tmp/.rig';           # explicitly use a file
        use rig -engine => 'base';                # chooses the current engine
        use rig -path   => qw(. /home/me /opt);   # not implemented yet

        use rig moose, strictness, modernity;

        use rig 'kensho';            # loads a rig called kensho
        use rig ':kensho';           # skips files, goes straight to rig::task::kensho
        use rig 'kensho::strictive'; # skips files, uses rig::task::kensho::strictive
        use rig 'signes';

  ".perlrig" YAML structure
       <task>:
          use:
             - <module> [min_version]
             - +<module> 
             - <module>:
                - <export1>
                - <export2>
                - ...
          also: <task2> [, <task3> ... ]

   use section
    *   Lists modules to be "use"d.

    *   Checks module versions (optional).

    *   Lists exports (optional).

    By default, modules in your rig are imported by calling "import".

    Alternatively, a plus sign "+" can be used in front of the module to
    force it to be loaded using the "eval" method, as such:

        eval "package <your_package>; use <module>;"

    This may be useful to workaround issues with using import when none is
    available and "rig" fails to detect a missing import method, or things
    are just not working as expected.

    Used to bundle tasks into each other.

       modernity:

             - warnings
             - feature:
                - say
                - switch
       moose:
          use:
             - Moose 1.0
             - Moose::Autobox
             - autodie

             - warnings

                - first
                - max
                - min
             - Scalar::Util:
                - refaddr
             - Carp:
                - cluck
                - croak

The .perlrig file
    The .perlrig file is where you keep your favorite rigs.

    As mentioned earlier, "rig" looks for a ".perlrig" file in two
    directories by default:

       * The current working directory.
       * Your home directory.

    Important: only one rig file is loaded per "perl" interpreter instance.
    This will probably change in the future, as ".perlrig" file merging
    should be implemented.

  Structure
    It could have had room to put your funky startup code, but it doesn't.
    This module is about order and parseability.

    Having a structured file written in plain yaml makes it easier for
    worldly parsers to parse the file and understand your configuration.

  Global Configuration
    Use the $ENV{PERLRIG_FILE} variable to tell "rig" where to find your
    file.

       $ export PERLRIG_FILE=/etc/myrig
       $ perl foo_that_rigs.pl

rig::task:: modules
    A more distribution-friendly way of wiring up module bundles for your
    application is to ship them as part of the "rig::task::" namespace.

       package rig::task::myfav;

       sub rig {
            return {
             use => [
                'strict',
                { 'warnings'=> [ 'FATAL','all' ] }
             ],
             also => 'somethingelse',
          };
       }

    This is the recommended way to ship a rig with your distribution. It
    makes your distribution portable, no ".perlrig" file is required.

  Out-of-the-box rig tasks
    This module comes with 2 internal rigs defined:

    *   Modern rig::task::modern

    *   Red rig::task::red

  Writing your own parser
    Although this distribution only comes with a yaml parser for the
    .perlrig file. you can still write your own parser if you like:

       package rig::parser::xml;
       use base 'rig::parser::base';

       sub parse { return .... } 

       # meanwhile in Gotham City:

       package main;
       use rig -parser => 'xml';
       use rig 'fav-in-xml';

CAVEATS
    Although short, the api and yaml specs are still unstable and are
    subject to change. Mild thought has been put into it as to support
    modifications without major deprecations.

  Startup Cost
    There's an upfront load time (on the first "use rig" it finds) while
    "rig" looks for, parses and processes your ".perlrig" file. Subsequent
    calls won't look for any more files, as its structure will remain loaded
    in memory.

  Ordered Load
    As of right now, module loading order tends to get messed up easily.
    This will probably be fixed, as the author's intention is to load
    modules following the order set by the user in the ".perlrig" and "use
    rig" statements.

ON NAMING THIS PACKAGE
    The authors feel that "rig" is a short name that is good for one-liners.
    It's lowercase because we feel it's a pragma-like module that augments
    the functionality of "use". But "rig" is a unique enough name as to
    avoid clashing with future Perl pragmas.

    We're sorry if it hurts anyone's lowercase sensibility.

TODO
    *   Create a class to hold the perlrig definition.

    *   Use Config::Any or similar for more agnostic and advanced file
        loading.

    *   Straighten out and optimize internals.

    *   Test many more modules for edge cases.

    *   More verbs besides "use" and "also", such as require, etc.

    *   A cookbook of some sort, with everyday examples.

    *   More tests.

    *   Fix load sequence.
